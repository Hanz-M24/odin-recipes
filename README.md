# odin-recipes

This project is about creating a page that shows a recipe of a certain dish.

The recipes that I picked was my favorite food and the food that I wanted to try which is the beef wellington.
What I learned about doing this project was that it helps me familiarize with html boiler plate and basic tags and attributes thats required to build a web page.
