    <p>Beef Wellington is a classic and luxurious dish known for its rich flavors and elegant presentation. It traditionally consists of a center-cut beef tenderloin, often a filet mignon or beef fillet, which is seasoned and then seared to lock in flavor. The seared meat is then coated with a layer of pâté—usually mushroom duxelles, a finely chopped mixture of mushrooms, onions, herbs, and sometimes liver pâté—followed by a thin layer of prosciutto or puff pastry to help contain moisture and add texture. The entire bundle is then wrapped in a sheet of puff pastry and baked until the pastry is golden and flaky, and the beef inside reaches the desired level of doneness, usually medium rare.</p>

    <p>The dish is believed to be named after Arthur Wellesley, the 1st Duke of Wellington, who famously defeated Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo. While the connection between the Duke and the dish remains uncertain, it became popular in England in the 19th century and has since become a symbol of British fine dining. Beef Wellington is particularly popular for festive occasions such as Christmas, New Year’s Eve, or other celebratory dinners. Due to its intricate preparation and the need for precise timing, it’s often seen as a culinary challenge, even for experienced chefs.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 1/2 pounds beef tenderloin</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons butter, softened, divided</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
            <li>2 ounces liver pâté</li>
            <li>1 (17.5 ounce) package frozen puff pastry, thawed</li>
            <li>1 egg yolk, beaten</li>
            <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can beef broth</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons red wine</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>


    <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Place beef tenderloin in a baking dish. Spread 2 tablespoons softened butter over beef.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove beef from the pan and reserve pan juices; allow beef to cool completely.</li>
            <li>Increase oven temperature to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Sauté onion and mushrooms in butter for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool.</li>
            <li>Mix paté and remaining 2 tablespoons softened butter together in a bowl; season with salt and pepper. Spread paté mixture over beef. Top with onion and mushroom mixture.</li>
            <li>Roll out puff pastry dough to about 1/4-inch thickness and place beef in the center.</li>
            <li>Fold up and seal all the edges, making sure the seams are not too thick. Place beef in a 9x13-inch baking dish, cut a few slits in the top of dough, and brush with egg yolk.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) and continue baking until pastry is a rich, golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read between 122 to 130 degrees F (50 to 54 degrees C) for medium rare. Set aside to rest.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, place reserved pan juices in a small saucepan over high heat. Stir in beef broth and red wine; boil until slightly reduced, about 5 minutes. Strain and serve with beef.</li>
            <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
